## Stakeholders

Jiajie Zou

Jiajie is a NYU student majoring in Computer Science. He is the creator of https://www.honkaistarrail.org/, a statistics calculator for one of his favorite moble game, Honkai: Star Rail, that allows users to quickly calulate some statistics of their game accounts. After some diligent effort on search engine optmization and the spread of words on social media platform, he finds 60,000 views per month for his website so far. He wants to grow further and potentially commercialize his work, but there are obstacles.

Here are the two problems he experienced during the development.

1. The codes of the website has poor organization, which makes the development of new feature harder. Jiajie doesn't have enough time to refactor all codes on himself, or otherwise he will stop develop new features for some time and potentially lose customers. He want to hire more, but doesn't have fund
2. The website contains lots of static information about the game, including the description of characters, abilities, and so much more. In addition, Jiajia wants to add game related content to the website, including mission walkthrough, characters recommendation, new patche review, etc, in order to compete with other game website. This requries a large amount of people writing contents for his app, which he couln't find.

Notice that the root cause of both problems is the lack of human resources, which can either be solved with money or by connecting with people who feel so passionate about the project(or the game) that they are willing to help wihout compensation. In fact one of Jiajie's main competitors solves the problem with the latter solution. They are a team of 30 people who really love the game that they build the website voluntarily. 

## Product Vision Statement

This product will connect organanizations with potential memebers.

## User Requirements

1. As a software developer working on a personal project, I wish to find more people who share the similar interest to work on it together so I can acclerate the progress. 
2. As a student with an interest in entrepreneurship, I wish to find people with various skill sets to build the minimuim viable product so I can kickstart my venture.
3. As a small business owner who doesn't understand tech at all, I need a group of software engineers to build a small piece of software for my business at a lower cost.
4. As a researcher in Artificial Intelligence, I need a group of people to label a dataset so reserach can be done at a lower cost.
5. As a high school student/college freshmen who is interested in Software Engineering/UIUX/Product Management, I possess some decent skill sets but can't find an internship due age. I need to join a small scale organizations who's willing to accept me so I can gain experience in the industry.
6. As a junior in Computer Science, I fail to find an internship for the next summer due to the tech layoffs. I desperately need a work experience over the summer so I can fill it in my resume and use it for the next hiring cycle.
7. As a competitive gamer, I need a group of equally competitive gamers to form a team so we can pariticpate in some tournaments.
8. As a casual soccer player, I want to join a local team so I can play with people I know and play every weekend.
9. As a tech company who needs a feature done before some deadline but don't have enough human resources, I need a small team of software engineer to build it on a short-lease basis and at a lower cost. (Cheaper Outsourcing)
10. As a product manager who just released an early version of a product, I need some users to help test and review so I don't have to rely on a QA team.
